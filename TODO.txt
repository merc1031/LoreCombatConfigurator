[x] Remove enable / disable of 5E spells and P2FE and Homebrew.
[x] Discover spells by Level by iterating relevant SpellLists for classes on SessionLoad
[x] [x] Caster <> Sorcerer + Wizard since they have same spell list
[x] [x] Do the same for ther specialized classes (Druid, Ranger, Cleric, Bard, Warlock)
[x] [x] Exclude EldritchKnight as the flavor is off
[x] [x] (Rogue, Fighter, Barbarian) do the same but for Abilities via collected spell lists
[x] For passives, use a 2 phase approach to collect passives via PassiveList guids and combine with PassivesAdded hardcoded via python scrript. Ensure this collection occurs onSessionLoad
[x] For classes:
    ClassDescriptions.lsx has Entries, if no ParentGuid == VanillaClass
                                         yes ParentGuid == Subclass
                        These can be used to find all Progression.lsx entries

[x] New spell idea
    Give N max level spells, and N + %  of each lower level spell
[] Spell affinity
    Filter allowed spells by SpellSchool based on lorefull ness annotations
    _Fey -> Illusion
[] Spell Kinds
    Intent -> Harmful, Control, Buff, Utility

[] spell slots???
    warlock spell slots???

[] possibly add items????

[] some way to allow user to add ability and passive set overrides?

[] fix kind and restriction overrides?

[] If its a boss, but not our enemy yet, what to do?
[] If boosts are different, what do we do? reapply? probaly should collect already added boosts we own that are different and do boost removal, delay boost add
